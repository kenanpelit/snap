snap
====

snap is a collection of shellscripts to create and prune btrfs snapshots easily.

Motivation
----------

The motivation of creating "snap" has been the lack of a proper btrfs snapshot
tool that just does one thing well. The reference tool for btrfs snapshots is
"snapper" which is a great piece of software. But on the other hand includes a
lot of bloatware... It is written in C++, uses dbus and xml and provides a bunch
of commands that can be done with "btrfs-progs" anyway. So, the goal of snap is
to provide a mechanism for creating and pruning btrfs snapshots easily without
requiring any additional tools but "btrfs-progs", "coreutils", "bash" and
"ruby".
