= snap

snap is a collection of shellscripts to create and prune btrfs snapshots easily.

== Motivation

The motivation of creating `snap` has been the lack of a proper btrfs snapshot
tools that just does one thing well. The reference tool for btrfs snapshots is
`snapper` which is a great piece of software. But on the other hand it includes
a lot of bloatware... It is written in {cpp}, uses dbus and xml, provides a bunch
of commands that can be done with `btrfs-progs` anyway... So, the goal of snap
is to provide a mechanism for creating and pruning btrfs snapshots easily
without requiring any additional tools but `btrfs-progs`, `coreutils` and `sh`.
